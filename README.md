# realtime-netcode
a case study on netcode for realtime multiplayer games; using Gabriel Gambetta's [guide on client-server architecture](https://www.gabrielgambetta.com/client-server-game-architecture.html).

the goal is to become familiar with common techniques when writing netcode for realtime simulations so as to make more experienced decisions when architecting netcode for serious projects.

my engine of choice for serious projects tends to be [Godot](https://godotengine.org), so these studies are built using Godot 3.4.4. These examples do not use any 3rd party libraries other than what is distributed with the stable build of Godot; additionally, these examples are intended to be a reference and probably should not be used in production.
